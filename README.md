# Book Recommendations from Charles Darwin

In this DataCamp project, I developed a content-based book recommendation system, which will determine which books are close to each other based on how similar the discussed topics are. I used Gensim's Tfidf Model and MatrixSimilarity to find the similar books to Charles Darwin's On the Origin of Species.

In the end, to get a better understanding of the relation between all the Darwin books in our corpus, we represent the similarity matrix as a dendrogram using heirarchical clustering.
